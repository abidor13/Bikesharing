# NYC Bikesharing

### Overview:


#### In this project, we worked with data visualization software "Tableau" to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines,Iowa. 
#### To do so, we analyzed some key data from a New York Citi Bike-Share dataset. Our first step was to figure out how the bike-share business actually work in New York City, then create a proposal on how we could execute this idea and make it work in Des Moines.
